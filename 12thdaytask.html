A freshman biology major stood up, took the microphone, and she asked, “What do you see as the greatest problem facing medicine today?”

		My mind quickly flashed to the countless physicians I have seen and heard publicly lamenting their life’s work on the internet, on podcasts, and in the news. Most of the opinions seem to concern the “medical industrial complex” and the alphabet soup of CMS, MACRA, CHIP, ACOs, APMs, BPCIs, TDABC, and more. Doctors hate value-based care. Doctors hate bureaucratic oversight of their practices. Doctors hate that they have no institutional support. Young doctors hate their increasing educational debt load coupled with the opportunity costs of not working and saving through the ten years or so after college. Doctors hate reading about fellow doctors committing suicide and the sense of burnout it instills.
